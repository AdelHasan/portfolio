# Project One Refactoring Notes

## Areas for improvement
- Fix the social links section
- Adjust the email form to be smaller
- Replace filler text in summary section
- Linear gradient for background color
- Add Projects section (wireframe first)
  - Add RL app to Projects section
- Fix images not loading bug on Github Pages
- Better Navbar (use/adjust a bootstap nav template)
- Fix scroll to (right now navbar blocks view of the element you scroll to)


I feel like a lot of these issues can be solved more reasonably by building out a backend and hosting this on a real service. Esp. Email form since I could have my own form controls set up rather than relying on prebuilt Google form components. I like the calendar inlay that I've seen, though I think that has to be linked to a sheet if it's anything like Tommy's. Maybe not though.
